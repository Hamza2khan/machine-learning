# üìñ Open Ended Lab Report

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction  
The **MNIST dataset** consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits **(0-9)** in a **28x28 pixel format**.  
This project aims to classify these digits using different machine learning models and a deep learning model.  
The dataset has been preprocessed into **CSV files (`mnist_train.csv` and `mnist_test.csv`)**, with each image represented as a **1D vector of 784 features**.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Methodology  

### **2.1 Data Preprocessing**  
- The dataset is **loaded** from CSV files using `pandas`.  
- Features are **scaled** using `StandardScaler` and `MinMaxScaler`.  
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is applied to reduce dimensionality.  
- Missing values are handled using `SimpleImputer`.  
- The dataset is **split** into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.  

### **2.2 Models Used**  
The following models were implemented and evaluated:  
‚úÖ **Logistic Regression**  
‚úÖ **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
‚úÖ **Decision Tree**  
‚úÖ **Na√Øve Bayes**  
‚úÖ **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Discussion  
The **best-performing model** was the **Tuned ANN**, achieving an accuracy of **97%**.  
The **neural network** performed well due to its ability to learn complex patterns in the dataset.  
Traditional models like **Decision Trees** and **Na√Øve Bayes** had lower performance due to their limitations in handling high-dimensional data.  

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion  
This project successfully implemented multiple machine learning models for classifying **MNIST digits**.  
The best-performing model was the **Tuned ANN with an accuracy of 97%**.  
Future work could involve using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for even better image recognition performance.
